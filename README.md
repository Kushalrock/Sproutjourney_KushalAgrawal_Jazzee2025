**Reimagining Early Education in India with Generative AI**

## 🎥 Pitch Video

We’ve created a **2-minute pitch video** (as per the hackathon guidelines) that showcases our product through animated storytelling, a product demo in the foreground, and a structured explanation of our approach and real-world impact.

> 🎙️ *Note: The video uses AI-generated voice (via ElevenLabs)* as part of our voice integration testing. We believe voice plays a key role in accessibility and immersion for early learners and wanted to reflect that in our pitch.
